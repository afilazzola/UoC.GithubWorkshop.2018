### 4.0 Hosting on Github

The end goal from this workshop is to have a product that is supported online to be a resource for other researchers, your collaborators, and even your future self. Ideally, you will have a completed repository with all the associated data, analyses, and a workflow that includes descriptions of the findings or annotations. The report essentially acts as an Executive Summary providing the summarized information in your analyses and likely what would be included in the manuscript. The datasets you can put into a specified folder so that they can be used for the next person. The readme file can also provide information about the repository and how best to use it. These are just common practices though that I found I use more frequently for my ecology research. You can also use these tools to generate a repository that stores all your code, your plant occurrence datasets (e.g. pictures, GPS coordinates), species lists, lab budgets, or more! The ability to push everything into a safe online repository that can be both public and private, provides a giant opportunity to make your work more accessible.

The final step here is turning your report page into the repositories online document. There are some syntax things that need to be considered when doing this. Previously, Github had an extremely ugly approach for trying to accomplish what we are doing, but thankfully it has been significantly simplfied. The first step is to rename the `XX.html` file that you would like to be the main website for your repository to `index.html`. More recently, whenever I create an `.rmd` file that I know is the main report page for my repository I name it `index.html` to begin with. This way, every time I edit the main `.rmd` file I simply `knit` the page and am good to go without any renaming. Beginning with that, rename the file to `index.html`. Send it online by committing and pushing. 

Next, go online to Github and find your repository. We are going to go under the settings area I showed earlier in the workshop. Click settings, then scroll down to **Github Pages** section. Under source you want to set the master branch to be where Github hosts the website. Save, and then there is one more step.

** Quick Note on Branches ** The reason Github is such a popular choice for programmers is because of certain features. Branches are on of those specific features and you can read about them in detail [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is). The short version is that branch creates a different identifier for when you are commiting files. Developers commonly create a **testing** branch to identify when the code they are adding is experimental vs using the **master** branch for the core operations. This method allows easy roll back when things go wrong. However, for the most part I rarely tend to use branches, despite their popularity. As a general rule of thumb, stay on the master branch.

The final step to getting your website supported is to put the URL in the `Website` section of your repository. The URL can be found under Settings and Github Pages section we were at earlier. However, the syntax is also standard:

> http://YourGithubUsername.github.io/YourRepositoryUsername

Click `Save` and then refresh. Assuming you have checked all three of the settings below, your `index.html` file will now be hosted online and the web address above. 
- Created index.html file
- Set source branch to master and save
- Add website address in website panel

Your report page is now published online. An important rule here is that if your repository is private, the website for your `index.html` page is **NOT**. That means anything in that page can be viewed by the public although the data and other components of your repository are protected. For the most part, I have found this advantageous. It provides an opportuntiy to more openly share results and findings without have to worry about data theft. It does mean though to be a bit more careful with what is placed in the report since certain collaborators have different requirements or ideas on how open the findings should be. 


### 4.1 Aesthetics for your website

R Markdown allows you to make the website have a bit more aesthetics to it. Since Markdown is essentially simplfied HTML you actually have the capacity to use HTML code interchangable, add CSS stylesheets or even more complicated coding such as Javascript or Jekyll.  However, let's assume your expertise does not go beyond R and what has been taught so far in this workshop. We want to pretty up our report page and can do this in the header section of the `.rmd` file. Currently the top of your header section should look like this:

``` 
---
title: "test"
output: html_document
---
```

These two calls state the title of the page and that the knitted output should be an html file. The `---` denotes where the header bigs and ends. This section of document is sensitive to spaces, case, and returns so it needs to be carefully formatted. 

The first thing we would like to add is a theme. The list of supported themes are available [here](https://bootswatch.com/), but can extend beyond the list if you are willing to edit yourself. One of my favourite themes and the one currently used for this repository is *sandstone*. To change the theme of your repository add it below the `html_document` call and include a colon. The format should look like this:

``` 
---
title: "test"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: sandstone
---
```

Now `Knit` the file and you will the change in text, headers, and formatting. If you wanted your own theme, you could replace that line with `css : styles.css` for a customized stylesheet that you designed. 

The next common feature individuals want is a table of contents. I prefer a floating table of contents that appears in the right panel and allows for easy movement in between relevant sections. The first setting is to set table of contents to true. Here the default *depth* is set to 3, meaning that all headers that are level 3 or less will be included in table of contents. Put another way, any titles you put `###` in front of will appear in the table of contents. This can be changed by manipulating `toc_depth: x`. The final setting is floating table of contents to keep it visible with movement and scrolling through the page. The way this may commonly be set up is as shown below. 

```
---
title: Website
output:
  html_document:
    theme: sandstone
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
---
```

It is also recommend to add in more information into this header. Although it will not affect the file output, it is important for your own records and passing the information to others. I tend to recommend at least including the author(s) names and date the repository was created. 

```

    toc: true
    toc_float: true

```

This area could be used to set defaults for your document. Like we had mentioned earlier about fig dimensions, you may notice that all your figures need to be increased in size. Rather than adding that to each code chunk, you can set it as a deault in this section.
